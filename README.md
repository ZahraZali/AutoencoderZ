# AutoencoderZ
An advanced generalized autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction

AutoencoderZ is an advanced Autoencoder model designed for dimensionality reduction of various data types, such as seismometer and strainmeter data. It features an encoder-decoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs input data while preserving important features. The extracted features can then be used for various applications, such as unsupervised clustering, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.
